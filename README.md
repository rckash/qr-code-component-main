## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned how to use the proper units for styling.

### Useful resources

- [Are you using the right CSS units? YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5wpD9Ov_To&t=1s) - This helped me decide on what units I should use for my styling. Even though Kevin Powell has stated that he rarely uses the px unit, I have decided to use it for the card width of this project.
